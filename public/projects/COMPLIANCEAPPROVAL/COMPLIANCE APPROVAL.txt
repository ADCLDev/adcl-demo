Arch Design & Construction Limited has been involved in obtaining compliance approvals from various regulatory bodies in the construction industry in Bangladesh. These approvals are essential to ensure that building projects meet the necessary legal, safety, and environmental standards. The authorities involved include:

RAJUK (Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha): The central body for urban development and planning in Dhaka, ensuring adherence to building codes, land use policies, and development regulations.

CDA (Chittagong Development Authority): Responsible for regulating and approving construction projects in the Chittagong region.

Fire Service and Civil Defence: Approval from the Fire Service Department is required to ensure that buildings have adequate fire safety measures, such as emergency exits, fire alarms, and sprinkler systems.

City Corporations: Local city corporations (such as Dhaka North City Corporation and Dhaka South City Corporation) handle approvals related to utilities, waste management, and infrastructure support in urban areas.

Department of Environment (Poribesh): Provides environmental clearance to ensure that construction does not negatively impact the environment, including factors like air quality, waste disposal, and ecological balance.

Civil Aviation Authority: Compliance with height restrictions and other safety measures is mandatory for buildings located near airports, and approval from the Civil Aviation Authority is required to ensure these standards are met.

By coordinating with these bodies, Arch Design & Construction Limited ensures that their projects are compliant with legal standards, safe for public use, and environmentally sound.
